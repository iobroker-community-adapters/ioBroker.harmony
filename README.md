Control your harmony activities from ioBroker.

## Install
Install Harmony via ioBroker Admin.
Adapter should automatically find your Hubs.

## Usage

### Activities
**Start:**
Set the status state 'Instance.Hub_Name.activities.Activity_Name' to a Number greater than 0.
During the activity's startup sequence the status changes from 1 (startup) to 2(running)

**Stop:**
Set the state 'Instance.Hub_Name.activities.Activity_Name' to 0.
Alternatively, you can set the hub's status 'Instance.activities.currentStatus' to any number.
During the activity's exit sequence the status changes from 3 (stopping) to 0 (stopped)

### Indicators
There are two indicators 'Instance.Hub_Name.activity' and 'Instance.Hub_Name.connected'. Both are read-only, changing their values has no effect.

**.hubConnected**
Tells you whether the adapter is successfully connected to the hub.
 
**.hubBlocked**
Is set to true if Hub is busy starting/stopping activities or sending commands.
 
**activities.currentActivity**
Gives you the name of the currently running activity.

**activities.currentStatus**
Gives you the current status of the hub. 
- 0 = inactive
- 1 = starting
- 2 = active
- 3 = stopping

**activities.<activity name\>**
Status of this activity. Values are the same as above.


### Devices
**Send Command**  
Set 'Instance.Hub_Name.Device_Name.command' to a number x to send command for x milliseconds.
A value smaller than 250 probably will send the command only once.
After sending the state will be set to 0 again.
